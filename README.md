# Customer Rewards Program App

This React application simulates a customer rewards program for a retailer. Customers earn points based on the amount spent per transaction. The app provides an interface to view individual customer reward summaries, filter by month and year, and inspect transaction-level reward points.

## Features

**Rewards Logic**

  * 2 points for every dollar over **\$100**
  * 1 point for every dollar between **\$50 and \$100**

**Customer Filtering**

  * Displays a list of all customers on the left
  * Allows selecting customer, month, and year

**Reward Summary**

  * Monthly and total reward points shown side by side

**Recent 3 Months View**

  * Shows transactions in the last 3 months by default

**Paginated Transaction Table**

  * Handles large data with clean pagination

**Unit Tests**

  * Positive and negative cases for reward calculation (with decimals)

**Styled Components**

  * UI styled with `styled-components` for modular and reusable styles

## Rewards Calculation Example

For a transaction amount of **\$120**:

* Over \$100: `(120 - 100) * 2 = 40` points
* Between \$50 and \$100: `(100 - 50) * 1 = 50` points
* **Total = 90 points**

---

## Tests

Unit tests are located under `__tests__` .

### Positive Cases

* Amounts over 100
* Amounts between 50â€“100
* Exact boundary amounts

### Negative Cases

* Amounts under 50
* Invalid/missing data

 ### Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
# or if using vitest
npx vitest run
```

---

## Technologies Used

* **React 18+**
* **Vite** for fast build/dev
* **Styled Components**
* **PropTypes** for runtime type-checking
* **Jest/Vitest** for testing
